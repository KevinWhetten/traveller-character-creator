  <h1>Military Academy</h1>
  <p>For those who are looking to dedicate their lives to military service, there is no better option than joining
    an academy to round out an education. This is a popular choice for those coming from 'military' families or
    those having grown up never considering anything other than a life in uniform. A term within a military academy can
    set a recruit's career for great things, so competition to gain one of the limited number of open student slots is
    fierce.</p>
