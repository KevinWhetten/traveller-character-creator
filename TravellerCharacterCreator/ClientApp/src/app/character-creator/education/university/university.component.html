<h1>University</h1>
<div>
  <p>Most worlds have one or more universities within their major sttlements, but even citizens of the most remote
    system can engage in university through the use of computer networks and interstellar communications. A
    university education will channel a character's efforts into a narrow range of skills, but there are few other ways
    to become more skillful with them so quickly.</p>
