The far trader swaps cargo space and low berths for a larger jump drive and fuel tank, allowing it to reach systems a basic free trader cannot travel to. While less cargo can mean less profits, the ability to reach farther systems or to travel between stars at a faster rate can more than make up for this in the hands of a clever captain.",
